# factorio-janitor

Instantly investigates and indiscriminately invites import of items to your inventory. Logistically, rationally. From blueprints, specifically.

## Blueprint Janitor

This was previously in the before-times an exceptionally simple mod that de-cluttered blueprints from your main inventory (but not the quickbar - NEVER the quickbar.)

But now, in the now times, it is not at all what it once was. Now it is whatever I made it. And I think I made this: look at the screenshots above and gaze upon the text therein to unlock the mystery.

A button you click that requests items from the logistic network for the blueprint you're "holding". EZPZ.
