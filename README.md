# Blueprint Janitor

This was previously in the before-times an exceptionally simple mod that de-cluttered blueprints from your main inventory (but not the quickbar - NEVER the quickbar.)

But now, in the now times, it is not at all what it once was. Now it is different.

A button you click that requests items from the logistic network for the blueprint you're "holding". EZPZ.

Please check out [my other addons](https://mods.factorio.com/user/folk) as well! For example [Tidy Pls!](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/folk/folk-tidypls) or [Shuttle Train Lite](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/folk-shuttle).

## LOL

So, for those of you (like me) who had no idea, the base game kind of has this functionality already though not all of it. Please read https://mods.factorio.com/mod/folk-janitor/discussion/6730ad79b190dc0e5225601e lulz
