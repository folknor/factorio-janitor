button-tooltip=__CONTROL_LEFT_CLICK__ the button with a __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__blueprint in your cursor__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ to add all required items for the blueprint to a logistic section in your inventory called __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__Janitor__REMARK_COLOR_END__. Repeat as required.\n\n__CONTROL_RIGHT_CLICK__ to clear the logistic section called __REMARK_COLOR_BEGIN__Janitor__REMARK_COLOR_END__.\n\n__CONTROL_KEY_SHIFT__ + __CONTROL_LEFT_CLICK__ to add 10 times the required items.\n\nPlease note that as of this version of the mod, clicking the button with a blueprint book in your cursor will not do anything. This was not my intention, but I'm limited by the exposed scripting functionality.
no-blueprint=Pick up a blueprint before asking the janitor for help.
